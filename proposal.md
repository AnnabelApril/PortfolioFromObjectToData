### Research theme: 
IS and the western journalism; a media hype; a self-reinforcing news process; or “just news”?

### Questions:
1.	What is a ‘media hype’ and a ‘self-reinforcing news process’?
2.	What is the pattern of IS related terms (IS; Isis; Islamic State) on the websites of the NRC Handelsblad and New York Times surrounding the dates of the terroristic attacks in Europe (in chronological order: Charlie hebdo, Paris Bataclan, Zaventem, Nice)?
3.	Does one of Stefan Geiss’ types of a ‘news wave’ fit the found pattern? 

### Methodology:
1.	Literature research; define the terms. 
2.	 I will use R studio to search the metadata of the API’s from NRC Handelsblad and New York Times websites to filter the articles written at the day of the attacks and the six days following each attack. Then I will use RegExr. to form a code which will search the articles per day on the three IS related terms: IS; Isis; Islamic State. The found data will be set out in a graph.
3.	I will use the graph to compare the data (found at question 2.) with Stefan Geiss’s theory about ‘news waves’. 

### Hypothesis:
I chose NRC Handelsblad and New York Times, because they are both liberal, western newspapers. The difference is: one is set in the EU and one in the USA, so there is a difference in the relative geographical distance to the attacks. This might influence coverage on the matter and thereby the form of ‘news waves’ in both newspapers.  
I think the data analysis on both these newspapers will uncover the way IS related news becomes a media hype in one or both of the newspapers and that the news wave pattern in the EU will be more intense than in the USA before “other” (non-related IS) news will takeover. 
This may strengthen assumptions like: IS really does have influence on our journalism, so they do get what they wish for; attention. 

### Visualization:
We will create a line graph to support the findings from our data set. The line graph will be visualized using R and RStudio.
