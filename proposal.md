### Research theme: 
IS and the western journalism; a media hype; a self-reinforcing news process; or “just news”?

### Questions:
1.	What is a ‘media hype’ and a ‘self-reinforcing news process’?
2.	What is the pattern of IS related terms (IS; Isis; Islamic State) on the websites of the NRC Handelsblad and New York Times surrounding the dates of the terroristic attacks in Europe (in chronological order: Charlie hebdo, Paris Bataclan, Zaventem, Nice)?
3.	Does one of Stefan Geiss’ types of a ‘news wave’ fit the found pattern? 

### Methodology:
1.	Defining the search terms: we chose to work with article keywords "Isis", "IS", "Islamic State" and the corresponding term used in the East: "daesh";
2.	Obtaining the articles corresponding to the three chosen time periods (of three different attacks carried by ISIS) using NYT API, and LexisNexis archive for the NRC Handelsblad (running command line);
3. Refining and organizing data using R Studio, arranging the articles corresponding to the publication date and comparing it to Geiss's News Waves theory;
4. Using regular expressions, exploring the articles further for any additional conclusionsons on the Western news coverage of the three attacks;
5. Visualising the different findings using R Studio.


### Hypothesis:
I chose NRC Handelsblad and New York Times, because they are both liberal, western newspapers. The difference is: one is set in the EU and one in the USA, so there is a difference in the relative geographical distance to the attacks. This might influence coverage on the matter and thereby the form of ‘news waves’ in both newspapers.  
I think the data analysis on both these newspapers will uncover the way IS related news becomes a media hype in one or both of the newspapers and that the news wave pattern in the EU will be more intense than in the USA before “other” (non-related IS) news will takeover. 
This may strengthen assumptions like: IS really does have influence on our journalism, so they do get what they wish for; attention. 

### Visualization:
We will create a line graph to support the findings from our data set. The line graph will be visualized using R and RStudio.
