###Reflection  
What I mostly leant during this period is that one can do great things with just a couple codes. This class and the lessons gave me much more confidence in my computer and coding skills. I became very fond of RStudio as a place to run codes and work on things. I noticed that I found command line very hard and frustrating. Why RStudio was so great is that it was very clear and things just mostly went right. Further regarding the research, it was really enjoyable to be able to work in a group. Everyone had their strengths but still helped each other with everything, a critical eye was very useful. I spent the most time plotting the graphs for the visualization of our project in RStudio, which was actually very gratifying seeing your work visualized. I learnt many skills during this period and even more useful many programs to make it a bit easier. I found this class enjoyable and usefull.
